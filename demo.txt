%pyGroff, A tiny Syntax guide
@Subhaditya Mukherjee

# Arguments needed
- -f : input file path
- -o : output file name. (Dont give path!)

# Main syntax
*Note that you have to remove the <>
~% <title> : Adds a title like the one in this document
~@ <author> : Author name
~<text> : move to the center (left is default)
~<text> : move to the right
~# <text> : Heading level 1
~## <text> : Heading level 2.. and so on
~- <text> : Lists
 ~ : if you want to use one of the above in a sentence but do not want it to be formatted. Like this document.
~* <text> : bold
~/ <text> : italics

# Limitations for now
- If you have added a title and an author, you must add a body or you will get errors
- Formatting can only be applied to the whole row
- If you are using < or > , please leave a line gap

> Thank you
