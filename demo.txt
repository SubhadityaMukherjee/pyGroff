# Main syntax

## General 
*Note that you have to remove the <>
~% <title> : Adds a title like the one in this document
~@ <author> : Author name
~< <text> : move to the center (left is default)
~> <text> : move to the right
~# <text> : Heading level 1
~## <text> : Heading level 2.. and so on
~- <text> : Lists
 ~ : if you want to use one of the above in a sentence but do not want it to be formatted. Like this document.
~* <text> : bold
~/ <text> : italics
~_ <text> : underline
~+ <text> : New page

## Advanced
~| <text> : Table. Format is |[title](1;3;4;5;6,1;3;4;8;9). Separate rows with , and lines with ;
~! <image name.jpg> : Make sure it is in the same directory. Or specify the full path. Note that it will be converted to .eps format. 
~^ <code> : Python code, in quotes like : "import numpy as np; z = np.random.rand(3,3);print(z)" . Please separate lines by ;

## Need a cover page?
*Use the arguments

- -c True
- -n "Your name"
- -t "Project title"
- -d This is optional. But it can be another date format

# Limitations for now
- If you have added a title and an author, you must add a body or you will get errors
- Formatting can only be applied to the whole row
- If you are using < or > , please leave a line gap
- If you see any numbering/formatting not working, just leave a line gap. It should mostly work out. If not. File an issue

# What about code

^import numpy as np;z = np.random.rand(3,3); print(z)

# What about tables
