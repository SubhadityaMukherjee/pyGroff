# pyGroff

- A wrapper for groff using python to have a nicer syntax for groff documents
- Very similar to markdown. So if you know what that is. You will love this :)
- We hate word -.-
- Editing pdfs is a pain and please we are lazy
- We love markdown. But we need pdfs and docx. So why not 
- LaTEX is amazing but it is tooo much work for small things.
- Vim is love. What can we do without keyboard shortcuts ):

## What can you do
- Write in a text file
- Get auto generated, beautifully formatted pdfs and docs instantly
- Not cry because you moved an image and now your document is in hieroglyphics

## Syntax
- Check syntax.pdf and demo.txt for an example
- Refer to syntax.pdf for new, easier syntax :)
- This was also generated by the program hehe

## Requirements
- Almost every unix system has groff preinstalled
- Which means no windows. (Unless you are using WSL. In which case its coool)
- You need python of course
